layer:
  id: "transportation"
  description: |
      **transportation** contains roads, railways, aerial ways, and shipping
       lines.
      This layer is directly derived from the OSM road hierarchy.
      At lower zoom levels major highways from Natural Earth are used.
      It contains all roads from motorways to primary, secondary and
      tertiary roads to residential roads and
      foot paths. Styling the roads is the most essential part of the map.
      The `transportation` layer also contains polygons for features like plazas.

          Distinguish between more and less important roads or railways and roads under construction.
          Class is derived from the value of the
